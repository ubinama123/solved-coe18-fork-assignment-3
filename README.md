<ul>

 <li>Test drive a C program that creates Orphan and Zombie Processes</li>

 <li>Develop a multiprocessing version of Merge or Quick Sort. Extra credits would be given for those who implement both in a multiprocessing fashion [ increased no of processes to enhance the effect of parallelization]</li>

 <li>Develop a C program to count the maximum number of processes that can be created using fork call.</li>

 <li>Develop your own command shell [say mark it with @] that accepts user commands (System or User Binaries), executes the commands and returns the prompt for further user interaction. Also extend this to support a history feature (if the user types !6 at the command prompt; it shud display the most recent execute 6 commands). You may provide validation features such as !10 when there are only 9 files to display the entire history contents and other validations required for the history feature;  (5) Develop a multiprocessing version of Histogram generator to count the occurrence of various characters in a given text.</li>

 <li>Develop a multiprocessing version of matrix multiplication. Say for a result 3*3 matrix the most efficient form of parallelization can be 9 processes, each of which computes the net resultant value of a row (matrix1) multiplied by column (matrix2). For programmers convenience you can start with 4 processes, but as I said each result value can be computed parallel independent of the other processes in execution.</li>

</ul>

Non Mandatory (Extra Credits)..




<ul>

 <li>Develop a parallelized application to check for if a user input square matrix is a magic square or not. No of processes again can be optimal as w.r.t to matrix exercise above.</li>

 <li>Extend the above to also support magic square generation (u can take as input the order of the matrix..refer the net for algorithms for odd and even versionâ€¦)</li>
